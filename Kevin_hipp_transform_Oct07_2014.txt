# of two image volume, and use the trasformation to warp the hipp mask


Step 1: we need to git clone kevin's code

Step 2: since kevin is using itk vtk cgal, we need to set up the enviorment; 
       it is just ot use synaptic pakage manager to install libsighttoolkit4-dev
      , and libvtk5-dev, and libcgal-dev;

Step 3: then we can go to the code folder, install ccmake. then, type in :
        ccmake ./   
        type c;
        type c;
